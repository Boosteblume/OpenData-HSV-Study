##Airflow
###Setting it up
To start with airflow it was necessary to install a linux distribution for windows. That was done by installing wsl2 and debian.
Then I installed python3 in debian followed by airflow.
To keep working with that I cloned the git repository into the debian distro so the files are in the same env as the airflow files.
Therefore I needed to change the py engine also to the one, which was in the debian env.
